# CodeTunes

* Sometimes programming becomes **depressing activity**, no matter in what 
  language the codes are written its sometimes hard to even go through them. 

* This repository contains a fun activity, to **make your code generate healing
  and melodious music** rather than rather generate compliation errors ! run 
  time errors like stack smash ! segfault ! abort core dumped !
